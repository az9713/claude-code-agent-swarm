## Why This Fork Exists

This fork was created to **demystify Claude Code's hidden swarm mode**:

| Goal | Status | Documentation |
|------|--------|---------------|
| **Understand** how swarm mode is unlocked | Done | [IMPLEMENTATION-DETAILS.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION-DETAILS.md) |
| **Test** swarm mode on a real full-stack task | Done | [todo-app/](todo-app/) |
| **Document** all issues and limitations found | Done | [TEAM-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md](docs/TEAM-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md) |

### What Was Found

Claude Code (running as an isolated variant via claude-sneakpeek) deployed a 3-agent swarm to build a full-stack authentication system. **The task succeeded, but critical issues were discovered:**

- **Task visibility failure** - 2 of 3 agents couldn't see assigned tasks
- **Message delivery failure** - Direct messages were "sent" but never received
- **Zombie agents** - Unresponsive agents couldn't be terminated
- **No force-terminate** - No way to kill uncooperative agents

**Full analysis:** [docs/TEAM-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md](docs/TEAM-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md)

### The Test Project

Claude Code built a complete todo-app with JWT authentication using the swarm:
- Express.js backend with bcrypt password hashing
- Vanilla JS frontend with login/register forms
- 42 tests passing
- OpenAPI documentation

**See:** [todo-app/](todo-app/)

# Original claude-sneakpeek README

Get a parallel build of Claude Code that unlocks feature-flagged capabilities like swarm mode.

This installs a completely isolated instance of Claude Code—separate config, sessions, MCP servers, and credentials. Your existing Claude Code installation is untouched.

## Install

```bash
npx @realmikekelly/claude-sneakpeek quick --name claudesp
```

Add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH if not already (macOS/Linux):

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

Then run `claudesp` to launch.

## What gets unlocked?

Features that are built into Claude Code but not yet publicly released:

- **Swarm mode** — Native multi-agent orchestration with `TeammateTool`
- **Delegate mode** — Task tool can spawn background agents
- **Team coordination** — Teammate messaging and task ownership

## Commands

```bash
npx @realmikekelly/claude-sneakpeek quick --name claudesp   # Install
npx @realmikekelly/claude-sneakpeek update claudesp         # Update
npx @realmikekelly/claude-sneakpeek remove claudesp         # Uninstall
```
